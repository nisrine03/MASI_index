#Time Series Analysis of the MASI Index
This project focuses on the time series forecasting of the MASI index, a significant benchmark for stock market performance. Leveraging time series analysis, particularly with LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks, this project aims to predict the MASI index's trends, a crucial factor for stock price forecasting.

#Dataset
The dataset consists of 2,366 records, capturing the MASI indexâ€™s daily fluctuations over the last 10 years (from 06/12/2013 to 08/12/2023), excluding holidays and weekends. This dataset enables a deep exploration of stock trends in Morocco's financial market.

#Approach
Given the sequential nature of financial data, we opted for LSTM architecture, which is well-suited for handling time-dependent patterns and making robust forecasts.

#Usage
To replicate or further develop the analysis, clone this repository and follow the provided steps for data preparation, model training, and prediction.
